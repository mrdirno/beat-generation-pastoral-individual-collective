## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a chapter from the perspective of Marta, detailing her first winter alone in the cabin and the moment she decided to seek others.
- Create a 'found document' from the commune: a page from their collectively-written 'Un-Catalog' of skills and philosophies.
- Write a scene where a new arrival, very different from Leo, challenges the commune's established 'vibe'.
- Imagine a chapter set five years later, when a journalist from the city arrives to write about the 'lost commune' and gets more than they bargained for.

### Technical Entry Points

- Build a 'Vibe Check' interactive tool that maps user inputs (e.g., preferred work, social need, comfort with chaos) to a chapter or theme from the book.
- Create a generative text model that writes in the style of the commune's collective journal, blending practical logging notes with haiku and philosophical fragments.
